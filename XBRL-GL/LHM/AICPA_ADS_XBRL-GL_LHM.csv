This standard includes up to 5 such dimensions, referred to as segments. The (up to) 5-segment listing tables map the values of each of the 5 segments to a text description of that value. The purpose of (optional) segments 1−5 is captured in the Base Standards questionnaire, question 10. XBRL GL provides more explicit context for the segments, and therefore does not require an implicit representation and an order to be associated with each segment grouping. Should it be deemed important to maintain the presentation order of the segments, the following fields can be used.
